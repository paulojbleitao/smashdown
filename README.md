# Smashdown

A website to help play the Smashdown mode in Smash Ultimate online, since Nintendo didn't include it in the official online modes. It helps you keep track of which fighters have been used, allowing you to click a fighter to mark it as used and unavailable. It also supports keeping track of wins.
